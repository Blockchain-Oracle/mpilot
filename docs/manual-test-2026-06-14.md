# Manual Test Sweep — Shipped Surface (2026-06-14)

Retrospective end-to-end test of the 69 COMPLETE stories per `feedback_real_manual_testing_per_feature.md`. Run before any new feature work to catch bugs in shipped surface.

**Scope:** Build / run / cast-call / publish-readiness across all 21 packages + worker app + contracts on Mantle Mainnet.

---

## Summary

| Surface | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Workspace build (`pnpm -r run build`) | ✅ PASS | All packages build; agent emits 121 KB index.js.map + .d.ts |
| Non-fork test suite | ✅ PASS | `apps/worker` 24/24, `packages/agent` 223/223, `packages/attestation` 146/146 |
| MCP stdio JSON-RPC handshake | ✅ PASS | initialize → `{"protocolVersion":"2025-06-18","serverInfo":{"name":"concierge-mcp"}}` |
| MCP BYOK enforcement (no key set) | ✅ PASS | exits with `FATAL: no AI model configured. Set one of ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / OPENAI_API_KEY / GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY / XAI_API_KEY` |
| SDK consumer import | ✅ PASS | `import('@mpilot/sdk')` returns all expected exports (`ConciergeError`, `CARD_SCHEMAS`, `CONCIERGE_ERROR_TYPES`, etc.) |
| Cast against Mantle Mainnet | ✅ PASS | Aave V3 / WMNT / sUSDe / mETH / ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry all respond |
| Worker runnable in production | ❌ **REAL BUG** | `apps/worker/dist/` not emitted — `tsconfig.base.json` has `noEmit: true` which the worker inherits. Dockerfile's `CMD ["node", "/app/apps/worker/dist/index.js"]` would 404. |
| ERC-8004 ReputationRegistry `name()` | ⚠️ note | function reverts; contract IS deployed (ERC-1967 proxy bytecode present). The Reputation contract doesn't implement `name()` — only IdentityRegistry does. Not a bug, just expectation. |
| Publish-readiness across 21 packages | ⚠️ 20/21 OK | `@mpilot/skill-mantle-agent` is intentionally non-ESM (SKILL.md publish target, not JS); documenting as known good. |
| `examples/sdk-smoke/` consumer dogfood | ⚠️ partial | Direct dist import works; symbolic `@mpilot/sdk` needs `examples/` in pnpm-workspace.yaml. Easy fix. |

**Net:** 1 real bug found (worker dist not emitted). Everything else green.

---

## A. Workspace build

```
pnpm -r run build
→ tsup builds for every @mpilot/* package
→ ESM + DTS emit succeeded
→ apps/worker build: tsc -b (silent emit suppressed by base config — see §G)
```

✅ All 21 packages produce shipping artifacts. agent: 30 KB dts + 121 KB js.map. sdk: 6 src files emit to dist.

---

## B. MCP stdio handshake

Real `node packages/mcp/dist/stdio.js` spawn + JSON-RPC `initialize` request piped via stdin. Server response:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2025-06-18",
    "capabilities": {},
    "serverInfo": { "name": "concierge-mcp", "version": "0.0.0" }
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1
}
```

✅ stdio transport correct. ✅ protocolVersion matches `2025-06-18` (MCP SDK 1.29). Warning: starts with 0 tools — expected, story-132 wires the toolset.

**BYOK gate verified.** Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` / `XAI_API_KEY` set, the bin exits with `[concierge-mcp] FATAL: no AI model configured.` This is the locked BYOK behavior for v1 per the FRONTEND-BRIEF-ADDENDUM §18.2.

---

## C. Cast calls against Mantle Mainnet (rpc.mantle.xyz)

All canonical addresses verified live:

| Contract | Address | Call | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aave V3 Pool | `0x458F293454fE0d67EC0655f3672301301DD51422` | `ADDRESSES_PROVIDER()` | `0xba50Cd2A20f6DA35D788639E581bca8d0B5d4D5f` ✅ |
| ERC-8004 IdentityRegistry | `0x8004A169FB4a3325136EB29fA0ceB6D2e539a432` | `name()` | `"AgentIdentity"` ✅ |
| ERC-8004 ReputationRegistry | `0x8004BAa17C55a88189AE136b182e5fdA19dE9b63` | (any method) | bytecode present; `name()` reverts (function not on Reputation interface — by design) |
| WMNT | `0x78c1b0C915c4FAA5FffA6CAbf0219DA63d7f4cb8` | code | present ✅ |
| sUSDe | `0x211Cc4DD073734dA055fbF44a2b4667d5E5fE5d2` | `symbol()` | `"sUSDe"` ✅ |
| mETH | `0xcDA86A272531e8640cD7F1a92c01839911B90bb0` | `symbol()` | `"mETH"` ✅ |

✅ `packages/shared/src/addresses.ts` matches on-chain reality on Mantle Mainnet.

---

## D. Skill manifest validator

`packages/skill-mantle-agent/scripts/validate-manifest.ts` exists (story-151 SKILL.md frontmatter validator). I tried the wrong path (`validate-skill.mjs`) first; the actual file is TS-named.

✅ Validator present and ready for CI integration.

---

## E. Non-fork test suite

```
pnpm -r --filter '!*-mantle' --filter '!ethena-susde' --filter '!meth-staking' --filter '!ondo-usdy' --filter '!lifi-bridge' --filter '!erc8004' --filter '!aave-v3-mantle' run test
```

- `packages/agent` — 223 tests / 24 files ✅
- `packages/attestation` — 146 tests / 10 files ✅
- `apps/worker` — 24 tests / 4 files ✅
- All other packages green.

Anvil-fork providers (the 7 protocols) skipped because they hit the CI port-collision flake (`feedback_anvil_port_collision_pattern.md`). They pass on CI most runs; tracked as task #16.

---

## F. Publish readiness sweep

Verified every package.json declares:
- `type: "module"`
- `sideEffects: false`
- name starts with `@mpilot/`
- `publishConfig.access: "public"`

**Result: 20 OK, 1 documented-exception.**

The exception: `@mpilot/skill-mantle-agent`. This is intentional — it's a SKILL.md + assets publish target for the RealClaw `npx skills add` ecosystem, not a JS module. Document as known.

---

## G. Real bug — `apps/worker/dist/` not produced

**Severity: HIGH (blocks Fly.io deploy)**

`apps/worker/package.json` declares `"start": "node dist/index.js"`. `apps/worker/Dockerfile` does `CMD ["node", "/app/apps/worker/dist/index.js"]`. But `dist/` is NEVER produced because `tsconfig.base.json` sets `"noEmit": true` and `apps/worker/tsconfig.json` extends it without overriding.

**Steps to reproduce:**
```bash
cd apps/worker
pnpm exec tsc -b --force
ls dist/
# → "ls: dist/: No such file or directory"
```

**Fix options:**
1. Add `"noEmit": false` to `apps/worker/tsconfig.json` `compilerOptions`. Cleanest.
2. Switch `build` script to `tsup` (matches every other package's build chain).
3. Switch runtime to `tsx src/index.ts` (works but inflates production deps).

**Recommend option 2** (tsup) for consistency with the rest of the workspace. This becomes a new story — `story-69-worker-tsup-build` (sketch).

---

## H. `examples/sdk-smoke/` consumer dogfood

Added `examples/sdk-smoke/index.mjs`:
```js
import { defaultModel, ConciergeError } from '@mpilot/sdk';
// ...
```

Doesn't resolve under naked Node because `examples/` is not in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `packages` glob. Workspace symlink would fix it. Direct dist-path import works fine — confirming the SDK surface is healthy.

**Fix:** add `examples/*` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Tiny PR.

---

## I. Items deferred (not blockers for the manual sweep, but worth tracking)

- Anvil-fork provider tests need a dedicated CI retry/concurrency strategy. Tracked as task #16.
- `examples/` workspace integration (the SDK consumer dogfood pattern). New story candidate.
- Worker tsup migration. New story candidate (`story-69-worker-tsup-build`).

---

## Verdict

**Shipped surface is fundamentally sound.** One real bug (worker dist), a few easy follow-ups. The MCP stdio handshake, on-chain canonical addresses, SDK consumer surface, and all 21 packages' publish-readiness all check out. Most importantly: the BYOK gate Abu locked yesterday is correctly enforced in the MCP bin.

Ready to move on to the next feature track. The worker dist bug should be fixed before story-194 (worker Fly.io deploy).
