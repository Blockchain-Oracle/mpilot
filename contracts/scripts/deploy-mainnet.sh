# deploy-mainnet.sh — Interactive Mantle Mainnet deploy wrapper for DeployAll.s.sol.
#
# Steps:
#   1. Pre-flight: env vars, cast/forge/node/gh present, MNT balance ≥ 0.3, clean git tree, CI green
#   2. Chain-id verification (guard against pointing at Sepolia or another chain)
#   3. Summary printout (irreversibility warning)
#   4. Exact-string confirmation: type DEPLOY-MAINNET (not y/N — fat-finger-safe)
#   5. forge script --broadcast only (secrets via env, not argv — invisible to ps aux)
#   6. forge script --verify --resume (non-fatal — Mantlescan outage must not strand a deploy)
#   7. write-addresses.mjs --network mainnet
#   8. postdeploy-smoke.mjs
#   9. Next-steps reminder
