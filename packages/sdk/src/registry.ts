 * by reference, never a copy — so there is exactly one source of truth and
 * mutation is impossible (shared deep-freezes it; instances freeze too).
 *
 * Implements `ConciergeAgentLike`, so a registry can be handed directly to
 * `createConciergeTools` / any adapter factory as the agent context.
 *
 * Sepolia note: non-ERC-8004 Sepolia addresses are zero placeholders until
 * story-192's mock deploy lands — see `@concierge/shared/addresses.ts` and
 * `SEPOLIA_PENDING_ADDRESS_SLOTS`. Use `requireAddress` instead of reading
