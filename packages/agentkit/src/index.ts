/**
 * Build an AgentKit `ActionProvider` from the Concierge registry, ready for
 * `AgentKit.from({ walletProvider, actionProviders: [provider] })`. Mirrors
 * `createConciergeTools(agent, providerToolFactories)`: omitting the
 * factories yields a provider with zero actions, and registry validation
 * errors (duplicate names, schema violations) propagate unchanged.
 *
 * ONE provider per process — ENFORCED. AgentKit 0.10.x stores custom-action
 * metadata on the shared CustomActionProvider class and `getActions`
 * resolves from it AT CALL TIME, so a second registration either silently
 * rebinds dispatch for overlapping tool names (last wins) or silently merges
 * disjoint actions into EVERY provider's `getActions()` (union leakage).
 * Both dispatch actions against the wrong agent context, so this factory
 * THROWS when custom actions are already registered in the process. The
 * guard fails CLOSED: an unrecognized metadata shape (an AgentKit bump
 * changing the registration model) throws rather than silently disarming,
 * and a zero-action provider stamps a sentinel so it still counts as THE
 * provider. Raw `customActionProvider` calls elsewhere bypass this guard —
 * the hazard is upstream's registration model, not this adapter's.
 *
 * Two more AgentKit behaviors consumers must know (verified against 0.10.4):
 *
 * - Action names surface PREFIXED as `CustomActionProvider_<toolName>` —
 *   AgentKit's CreateAction stamps `${ClassName}_${name}` on every custom
 *   action, and models address tools by the full prefixed name.
 * - Every action invocation fires AgentKit's own un-awaited telemetry fetch
 *   to `cca-lite.coinbase.com`, with NO rejection handler upstream. On
 *   Node >= 22 (this package's engine floor) an unreachable endpoint —
 *   air-gapped or egress-filtered deployments — therefore CRASHES the
 *   process via unhandled rejection on every action invocation, with a
 *   stack pointing into Coinbase analytics code. Allow that egress,
 *   intercept `fetch`, or install a targeted unhandledRejection handler;
 *   stub `fetch` in tests.
 *
 * Validation scope: AgentKit CORE only calls `schema.parse` (verified
 * against the 0.10.4 dist, pinned by tests), which is why zod-4 schemas
 * work inside zod-3-era AgentKit. Bridge packages that JSON-Schema-convert
 * `action.schema` with zod-3 tooling are NOT verified with zod-4 schemas
 * and may silently advertise an empty parameters schema — wire the provider
 * into `AgentKit.from(...)` and drive the model loop yourself.
 *
 * `outputSchema` is deliberately NOT enforced on the return value (same
 * policy as the langchain sibling): AgentKit's Action contract has no
 * return-shape slot — output validation belongs to the tool. Cancelling an
 * AgentKit run does NOT cancel an in-flight tool call — `ConciergeTool.invoke`
 * takes no abort signal, so a started execution runs to completion. Chain
 * gating runs ONCE at registration against `agent.chainId`; the AgentKit
 * `walletProvider`'s network is never consulted (closures are unary), and
 * upstream hardcodes custom providers' `supportsNetwork` to true.
